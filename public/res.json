I enjoy working on projects across the stack, from working on front-end frameworks (React, Django), to APIs (ASP.NET), to databases (SQL, MongoDB). I enjoy coding from both a creative and an analytical aspect, and I constantly challenge myself to learn new tools and algorithms. I look forward to every opportunity to create something bigger than myself.",
